# describe your project (1000 characters)
xiao 75% keyboard is compact tenkyless keyboard with pointing device.
Uses Kailh mini choc switch, Kailh X switch, and Seeed XIAO.
16mm pitch between keys, keyboard size is 249mm x 135mm.

# Details
<p>At time of writing this, Seeed studio is doing Seeed XIAO mechanical keyboard contest but it is completely irrelevant.</p>

<p>Motivation of this keyboard is I want compact, small keyboard with dedicated PageUp/PageDown key. Most of small keyboards mapped Fn+Up/Down for PageUp/PageDown but I fed up pressing Fn key for PageUp and PageDown!! Pointing device is also quite handy when I want to click something while typing.</p>

<ul>
<li>86 Kailh mini choc switches for keyboard keys.</li>
<li>2 Kailh X Switches for mouse buttons.</li>
<li>1 Top-up JT8P analog stick for pointing device.</li>
<li>Seeed XIAO as controller.</li>
<li>LED under each keyboard keys.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  XIAO has 11 IO pins. I used 10 IOs for key matrix and 1 IO for analog input to read X/Y of analog stick.<br>
  By using charlieplexing technique, 10Ã—9 switch matrix can be created. 2 cells of matrix are used to power analog stick.<br>
  External slide switch tunrs on/off LEDs as there wasn't enough pins to controll LED.
</p>

<p>
  I'll describe a bit how analog stick is sensed.<br>
  The analog stick I used is simply pair of potentiometer. To read position, connect VCC to one end, connect GND to the other end, and read divided voltage using analog input.

<p>
  Above circuit uses 2 analog inputs, but I have only 1 analog input. So connect 2 IOs to potentionmeters via diode like below image.

<p>
  If D10=H and D9=L, A1 value is position of X. If D10=L and D10=H, A1 value is position of Y.
